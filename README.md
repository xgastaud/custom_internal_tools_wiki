# Custom Internal Tools Wiki

**What are custom internal tools?**
- Anything that is not "client-facing" can be classified as an "internal tool"
- 'Standardized' internal tools support 'standardized' company processes: CRM, Helpdesk & Ticketing, Content Management, Applicant tracking, Business Intelligence, etc.
- 'Custom' internal tools support 'custom' company processes; these are intimitaly related to the way the business is run, how big/small internal teams are, how the company's apps and db are structured (monolith vs microservices, internally developped vs commercial services, etc.); they cover a broad range of needs: RBAC management, approval workflows, data management, etc.

...Simple, right?
