# Custom Internal Tools Wiki

What are custom internal tools?
- Anything that is not "client-facing" can be classified as an "internal tool"
- 'Standardized' internal tools support 'standardized' company processes: CRMs, Helpdesk & Ticketing tools, Data vizualization tools, etc.
- 'Custom' internal tools support 'custom' company processes: company internal home page, app admin panels, etc.
Simple, right?
